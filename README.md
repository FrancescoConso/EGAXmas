# EGAXmas
A Processing sketch I did in 2019, think of it as a digital Christmas Postcard. 
The idea was to play with the limitations of EGA format (16 color, 640x360 maximum resolution) and make something that could be posted on social media for Christmas. The result can be seen here:

The biggest hurdle of this was defining through code, and quad by quad, the models of the houses and the church. For sure there was going to be a better way, but a mix of me not knowing any better and a will to challenge myself to achieve even more an old-school look using (probably) old-school techniques made stuff go down that way.
